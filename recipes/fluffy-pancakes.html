        <p>Fluffy pancakes are a <strong>fantastic</strong> breakfast item to
        make when craving something fulfilling and tasty.</p>
        <p>The total time to make this recipe is negligable, taking only around 
        <em>20 minutes</em> from when you begin prepping to when you can start eating</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>¾ cup milk</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons white vinegar</li>
            <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons white sugar</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon baking powder</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon baking soda</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>1 egg</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons butter, melted</li>
            <li>cooking spray</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Combine milk and vinegar in a medium bowl and set 
                aside for 5 minutes to make sour milk.</li>
            <li>Combine flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt 
                in a large mixing bowl. Whisk egg and butter into soured milk. 
                Pour flour mixture into milk mixture and whisk until lumps are 
                gone.</li>
            <li>Heat a large skillet over medium heat, and coat it with cooking 
                spray. Pour 1/4 cupfuls of batter onto the skillet, and cook until 
                bubbles form and the edges are dry, about 2 to 3 minutes. 
                Flip with a spatula, and cook until browned on the other side. 
                Repeat with remaining batter.</li>
        </ol>
