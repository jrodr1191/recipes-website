        <p>This blend of appricot and rasperry provides a 
            <strong>unique</strong> experience compared to other
        desserts that may have been tried before.</p>
        <p>The prep and cook time is <em>very</em> short, only taking up
        around 30 minutes, with an additional two hours needed.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 cup butter, softened</li>
            <li>1 (8 ounce) package cream cheese, softened</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
            <li>¼ teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>¾ cup white sugar</li>
            <li>1 cup chopped walnuts</li>
            <li>¾ cup dried apricots, chopped</li>
            <li>¼ cup packed brown sugar</li>
            <li>1 ½ teaspoons ground cinnamon</li>
            <li>½ cup seedless raspberry preserves</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon milk</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Beat butter and cream cheese with an electric mixer 
                on low speed in a bowl until blended and smooth. 
                Beat in vanilla extract, salt, 1 cup flour, and 1/4 
                cup sugar until blended. Stir in remaining flour by 
                hand using a spoon.</li>
            <li>Divide dough into 4 equal pieces. Wrap each piece 
                with plastic wrap and refrigerate until firm, at 
                least 2 hours or overnight.</li>
            <li>Stir walnuts, apricots, brown sugar, 1/4 cup plus 2 
                tablespoons white sugar, and 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon in 
                a medium bowl until well-mixed. Set filling aside.</li>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Line 
                2 large baking sheets with foil and grease foil.</li>
            <li>Roll one piece of chilled dough on a lightly floured surface 
                with a floured rolling pin into a 9-inch round. Spread 2 
                tablespoons raspberry preserves on top. Sprinkle with about 
                1/2 cup apricot filling; gently press filling onto dough. 
                Cut dough into 12 equal wedges with a sharp knife or 
                pastry wheel. Starting at curved edge, roll up each wedge, 
                jelly-roll fashion. Place cookies on the prepared sheets, 
                point-side down, about 1/2 inch apart. Repeat with remaining 
                dough.</li>
            <li>Mix remaining 2 tablespoons sugar with 1 teaspoon cinnamon in 
                a small bowl. Use a pastry brush to brush rugelach with milk. 
                Sprinkle with cinnamon sugar.</li>
            <li>Bake rugelach in the preheated oven on 2 racks until golden, 
                30 to 35 minutes; rotate cookie sheets between upper and lower 
                racks halfway through baking time. Immediately remove rugelach 
                to wire racks to cool. Store cooled rugelach in a tightly covered 
                container.</li>
        </ol>
